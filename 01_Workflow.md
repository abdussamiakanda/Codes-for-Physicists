## Python Notebook

There are a few python notebooks.

To install either one, go to https://jupyter.org/install

I'll use JupyterLab. You can use jupyter notebook. They are basically the same thing.

If you're not sure which one to use first try it online. Just go to https://jupyter.org/try

If you can't install Python on your PC, that's okay. Just try this. Go to https://colab.research.google.com

This is just a clone for JupyterLab by Google.
